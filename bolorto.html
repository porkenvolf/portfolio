        Captain Bolorto was my first prototype game. It was made for the pico-8 fantasy console and it took me about a month to complete including all the assets,
        and the music. <br><br>

        I drew heavy inspiration from the game DoDonPachi since I wanted to focus on learning the tool instead of the design of the game itself. <br>
        Also I took it as a personal challenge to make the best shmup I possibly could, so I tried to emulate the best out there. <br><br>

        It features one level, one boss fight, a scoring system that incentivizes an aggressive playstyle, and multiplayer coop. <br><br>

        <strong>How to play?</strong>  <br>
        -Tap (O) repeatedly to fire your blaster. <br>
        -Hold (O) to fire your laser and move slower. <br>
        -Press (X) to use your shield once it's charged. <br>

        Every time you get hit you lose one hit point and one of your auxiliary blasters. If you are hit three times your ship explodes and you lose your score. You can keep playing though, as if you had infinite credits on an arcade.
