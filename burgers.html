        Banger Burgers was my first attempt at a procedurally generated NFT collection, having seen first hand the absolute speculative mania of NFTs in mid 2021
        , and wanting to take part. <br>
        It was quite the unusual project for me, and I didn't really know how to tackle it. And since I wanted to do something a little different I thought about making something animated. <br><br>
        First, I drew a buncha hamburger ingredients: bread, mayo, ketchup, meat, eggs, pickles, cheese, bacon, even pineapple!

        <div class="child_thumbnails"><a href="burgers/aseprite.png"><img src="burgers/aseprite.png" alt="" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></div>

        Then I generated around 10k possible combinations using those ingredients in Excel using a VBA macro, and made it spew a HUGE txt file with all those hamburgers,
        each one being a string of ingredientes separated by "-"

        <div class="child_thumbnails"><a href="burgers/excel.png"><img src="burgers/excel.png" alt="" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></div>

        After that I proceeded with the animation. <br>
        To this end I used the Godot game engine. It parsed the HUGE text file into an array of individual burgers, and one by one it rendered the previously designed animation. <br>
        Every frame of the viewport was saved as png in the background.

        <div class="child_thumbnails"><a href="burgers/godot.png"><img src="burgers/godot.png" alt="" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></div>

        Finally, using ImageMagick in a .bat script I created the 10k animated burgers as gifs using the previously generated frames. <br>
        10k animated burgers were assambled over three days of non-stop rendering.
        <div class="child_thumbnails"><a href="burgers/imageMagick.png"><img src="burgers/imageMagick.png" alt="" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></div>

        This is where the fun part ends. After the creative part I failed at the point of minting the collection and also with the marketing. <br>
        I managed to mint 100 Banger Burgers NFT manually using Holaplex, of which I sold exactly ONE! (If you're reading this, thanks, you rock!).
