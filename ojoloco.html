        Ojoloco was an experimental project in which I tried to explore generative art in a way that involved more randomness than my previous project, Banger Burgers. <br>
        I wanted something "abstract", and something pretty to look at. <br>

        <div class="child_thumbnails"><a href="ojoloco/1.png"><img src="ojoloco/1.png" alt="" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></div>

        Again, I used the Godot game engine, and what had worked great for Banger Burgers, ended up not being the best tool for Ojoloco. <br>
        The base of the generative algorithm was an invisible grid in a canvas, where one point in the grid would be randomly selected as the starting point. <br>

        <div class="child_thumbnails"><a href="ojoloco/godot.png"><img src="ojoloco/godot.png" alt="" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></div>

        Then a second point of the grid would be selected, and the two points would be connected by either a circle, a half-circle or a straight line. <br>
        The color of the connector would be also determined rolling a random number that would be defined as the hue of the color, having previoulsy fixed saturation and brightness. <br>

        After that, the loop would start again with the previously second node defined as the first node of the new loop. <br>
        When the generative part ended there was an algorithm that measeured the whole thing and generated it AGAIN, this time centered and scaled to fit the canvas. <br>

        This was a very fun project, and I'm very pleased with the result. <br>
        For my next gen art project I will explore other software options, like Processing, since Godot is very bad for drawing. <br><br>

        Here are some more pieces for you to look at:
